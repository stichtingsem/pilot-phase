# Project Team Decisions:
 - The Usage API will **not** be renamed to consumption API
 - Partners in the ecosystem are responsible (based on role(s)) for their own front-end/interface to demonstrate functionality
 - Setups:
    - Client ID can be used for multiple services
    - During PoC no central registration like OSR
    - Setup will be done at DigiDelivery Id level. Multiple DigiDeliveryID for one school = multiple setups

# Completed Backlog Items:
7. Adjust design Entitlement API (and or either regarding school and individual)
9. Match Catalogue API on ECK 2.3/2.4 (mandatory fields)
10. Adjust design Catalogue (add stream codes)
  - Conclusion: Stream codes will stay part of the design
11. Determine non happy flows/test scenario's (including returns & cancelations)
